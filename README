The clsem (command line semaphore) application provides command line
access to the Unix semaphore facility. Among other things, this
allows scripts to spawn a chosen number of child processes, and
spawn new children as current children exit. Thus, multi-process
scripts can distribute processes over multiple cores. See clsem (1).
